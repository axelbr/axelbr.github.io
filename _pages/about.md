I am a Ph.D. student in Reinforcement Learning at TU Wien, where I am part of the [Cyber-Physical Systems Research Group](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/orgs/e191-01), supervised by Prof. Radu Grosu. My research focuses on developing agents that are robust and adaptable to the behavior of collaborators and adversaries alike. I am particularly interested in integrating algorithmic game theory with modern reinforcement learning to design principled and scalable decision-making algorithms for multi-agent systems.

As part of my Ph.D. journey, I had the privilege of collaborating with Prof. Igor Gilitschenski during my time as a visiting graduate student in the [Toronto Intelligent Systems Lab](https://tisl.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto. Additionally, I gained industry experience as a part-time research scientist and engineer at [DatenVorsprung](https://datenvorsprung.at/en/home-english/).

Before my Ph.D., I completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at TU Wien, working on model-based reinforcement learning with Prof. Radu Grosu and [Dr. Ramin Hasani](http://www.raminhasani.com/).
